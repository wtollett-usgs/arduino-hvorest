# HVORest
HVORest is a REST server for Arduino boards. The [aREST](https://github.com/marcoschwartz/aREST) library was a big inspiration here (and what we initially used), but I realized that we didn't need 90% of the features of that library. Thus, HVORest and [HVOLib](https://github.com/wtollett-usgs/arduino-hvolib) were born.
